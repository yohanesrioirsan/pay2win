## About this project
Pay2WiN (Onine games topup service) is my first full-stack project is a MERN web app for online game top-up. The curiosity about how the backend creates APIs is a strong motivation for undertaking this project. After delving deep into it, I can evaluate that although I am not quite proficient in pure JavaScript logic yet, I will continue to strive to master it. Besides learning about backend, APIs, and servers, I also delved deeper into front-end development and web design. Please bear with me if it's not yet perfect; this is my first ever full-stack project, involving web design, flow, backend, frontend, etc., which has been quite a headache for me XD.
